## Nonstandard Directories
The following directories are not part of the standard R package:
 * `Datasets`: CSV versions of the *.rda data.frames officiallly included in the package.
 * `DocuemtnationForDevelopers`: Notes and links that should help package *developers* set up on their computer.  Typical package *users* won't have a need for this.
 * `PublicationGraphs`: A deprecated location that contains loose graphs of older versions of the manuscript.
 * `Playgrounds`: R snippets to help developers experiment with potential new features.
  * `UtilityScripts`: R scripts that aren't incorpated into the package.  They help automate certain tasks, or document how parts of the package were created.
